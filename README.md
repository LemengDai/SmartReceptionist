# Smart Door Receptionist with Smart Lock System

I created this smart security system using Python and HTML/CSS. It is used to see a visitor when the house's door is closed. Whenever a visitor rings the bell, an image of the visitor is captured by the camera and then sent to the email address of the house's owner. The owner then can go to a website where he/she can choose to unlock the door or keep the door locked.
